;; Add more system include path
;; By default, Semantic automatically includes some default system include paths
;; such as /usr/include, /usr/local/includeâ€¦ You can view the list of include
;; paths in semantic-dependency-system-include-path. To add more include paths,
;; for example Boost include paths, use the function semantic-add-system-include like this:

;; (semantic-add-system-include "/usr/include/boost" 'c++-mode)
;; (semantic-add-system-include "~/linux/kernel")
;; (semantic-add-system-include "~/linux/include")

;; If you want the system include paths to be available on both C/C++ modes,
;; then ignore the optional mode argument in semantic-add-system-include.

;; Enable EDE only in C/C++
